## ðŸ“œ **About Lautify** ðŸ“œ

"Lautify" addresses the pressing need to ensure the freshness of seafood in Indonesia's agriculture and fisheries sector through an innovative mobile application. With abundant marine resources, distinguishing between fresh and less fresh fish remains challenging for consumers. Our project focuses on developing a user-friendly solution for detecting fish freshness, leveraging image processing techniques.

### MVP Features

- **Fish Freshness Detection**: Users can capture a photo of the fish with their smartphone's camera. "Lautify" analyzes the image, focusing on the clarity of the fish's eyes to determine freshness.

- **Recipe Recommendations**: Based on the type of fish detected, "Lautify" provides users with a list of recommended recipes for cooking the fish.
